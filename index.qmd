## Agenda: Efficiency of Urban Environments

1.  Economic Efficiency: Agglomeration, Growth and Size of Cities.
2.  Environmental Efficiency: Urban Sprawl and Footprint.

. . .

### Some Questions

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Who lives (or moves) where, and what's the role of Housing?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2.  How does City Growth occur in the long run?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
3.  How are Fertility and City Growth connected?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
4.  Which policy mix will achieve net-zero emissions and keep inequality at bay?

## [Labor Market Mobility and Homeownership](https://floswald.github.io/publication/option-homeownership-2019/) {background-image="images/QE2019.png" background-size="50%" background-position="90% 60%"}

-   Regional Migration rates are low ðŸ‘‰ unimportant?
:::
::: {.fragment }
-   Heterogeneous Migration Elasticities and, hence, insurance.
:::
::: {.fragment }
-   Selection on unobservable types.
:::
::: {.fragment }
-   Estimate consumption value of shutting down migration. E.g. *Young* would demand 30% higher consumption.

## [Selection of Houses into Owned vs Rented](https://floswald.github.io/publication/housing-stock/)

::: {columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Questions

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Which characteristics of a house matter for selection into rented or owned sector?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2.  Conditional on selection, how are those characteristics priced?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
3.  Importance for homeownership theories?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: fragment
### Findings

1.  High-value houses ($m^2$ or *detached*) more likely owned, and have a *higher rent/price ratio*.
:::

::: fragment
2.  Rent/Price ratio varies greatly with location, $\Pr(own)$ does not.
:::

::: fragment
3.  Modeling and measuring unobserved quality is key for selection.

## [Mortgage Default and Lending Behaviour](https://floswald.github.io/publication/li-2017-recourse/)

::: {columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
::: fragment
-   Nevada decided in 2009 to abolish *Recourse Loans*.
-   Conduct an event-study on loan-level data. Control: Refinance loans (unaffected by change in law)
-   Approval rates declined by about 3%, loan sizes by 1-2%.
-   Placebo in counties outside Nevada's border confirm results.

::: {.column width="48%"}

### Contributions and Findings

-   First paper to use within-state variation in *recourse*.
-   We corroborate existing evidence: Default-friendly states have reduced mortgage supply.
-   We cannot say anything about welfare: maybe now insurance is greater for borrowers?
-   ðŸ‘‰ [Follow up with Meghir and Li](https://floswald.github.io/publication/bankruptcy-2019/)

### Land Use, Structural Change and Urban Expansion


::: {columns}

::: {.column width="44%"}
::: {.fragment}
#### Facts for France 1840-2020:
1. Rural Employment Share drops from 60% to 2% as workers move to cities.
:::
::: {.fragment}
2. The share of agricultural land in GDP goes from 400% to 10%.
:::
::: {.fragment}
3. House prices do *not* rise until the 1960s.
:::
::: {.fragment}
4. Urban Density falls 8-fold. 
:::
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}

::: {.fragment}
#### Model

* Spatial GE Model with 3 sectors and endogenous land use.
:::

::: {.fragment}
* Farmland getting cheaper and people spending more on housing <br> ðŸ‘‰ Density Falls.
:::
::: {.fragment}
* Commuting costs also fall! But implications are different.
:::

::: {.fragment}
* We provide a serious quantitative evaluation.

#### Extend model to K regions

* *If this mechanism has any bite, we want to see the cross section*
:::

::: {.fragment}
* Extend model to K regions

* Each with separate rural and urban productivity parameter.
:::

::: {.fragment}
* Aggregation consistent with productivity data.

::: {.column width="47%"}

::: {.fragment}
* Urban Population Distribution identifies urban productivity distribution
* Land Value Distribution identifies rural productivity distribution
:::

::: {.fragment}
* Model *extremely* close to data in OLS regression of urban density on rural price.
* For a subsample we can instrument price with wheat yields, same results.

## Fertility and Housing Costs: Contribution


::: {columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.fragment}
1. Document 5 stylized facts using Census Data.
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. Develop a quantitative spatial life-cycle model with endogenous fertility and demographics.
    - Sorting patterns across demographics
    - Fertility dynamics across time and space
    - Housing market: Automatic Stabilizer.

## Fiscal Policy for Climate Change


::: {columns}

::: {.column width=46%}
::: {.fragment}

#### Climate Inequality

* Cannot achieve first best solution, a Pigouvian Tax.
* (Constrained by Politics.)
* Inequality is key:
    - Damages are unequal
    - Policies affect people unequally
* We analyse the distributional consequences in this setting.
:::
:::

::: {.column width=46%}
::: {.fragment}
#### Contribution
1. Heterogeneous-agent framework with environmental externality.
2. Carbon intensity in entire economy: Energy, Final Goods, and Consumers.
3. Abatement Technologies.
4. **Our Question**: How to balance carbon taxes and subsidies to achieve net-zero by 2050?
