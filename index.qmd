## Agenda: Efficiency of Urban Environments

1.  Economic Efficiency: Agglomeration, Growth and Size of Cities.
2.  Environmental Efficiency: Urban Sprawl and Footprint.

. . .

### Some Questions

1.  Who lives (or moves) where, and what's the role of Housing?
:::

-   Regional Migration rates are low ðŸ‘‰ unimportant?
-   Heterogeneous Migration Elasticities and, hence, insurance.
-   Selection on unobservable types.
-   Estimate consumption value of shutting down migration. E.g. *Young* would demand 30% higher consumption.

## [Selection of Houses into Owned vs Rented](https://floswald.github.io/publication/housing-stock/)

::: {columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Questions

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1.  Which characteristics of a house matter for selection into rented or owned sector?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
2.  Conditional on selection, how are those characteristics priced?
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
3.  Importance for homeownership theories?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: fragment
### Findings

1.  High-value houses ($m^2$ or *detached*) more likely owned, and have a *higher rent/price ratio*.
:::

::: fragment
2.  Rent/Price ratio varies greatly with location, $\Pr(own)$ does not.
:::

::: fragment
3.  Modeling and measuring unobserved quality is key for selection.

## [Mortgage Default and Lending Behaviour](https://floswald.github.io/publication/li-2017-recourse/)

::: {columns}

-   Nevada decided in 2009 to abolish *Recourse Loans*.
-   Conduct an event-study on loan-level data. Control: Refinance loans (unaffected by change in law)
-   Approval rates declined by about 3%, loan sizes by 1-2%.
-   Placebo in counties outside Nevada's border confirm results.

### Contributions and Findings

-   First paper to use within-state variation in *recourse*.
-   We corroborate existing evidence: Default-friendly states have reduced mortgage supply.
-   We cannot say anything about welfare: maybe now insurance is greater for borrowers?
